// What the computer players say over the comms codec (0.57.0, owner: a voice for every faction - docs/owner/
// negotiation/Negotiation_Line_Gists.txt). The lines live in tools/lines/*.txt (tools/gen_lines.py ->
// ui/gen/lines.inc). Display only: a line is chosen by a hash the caller makes from the game's seed, the round
// and the pair - never from the game's dice, so saves replay exactly as before.
//
// Ways of speaking drawn here: the L1Z1X's words wrapped in machine junk with Lazaxian glyphs at both ends, the
// Nekro's two readable words buried in junk, the Obsidian entirely in the Lazaxian alphabet, the Glimmer of
// Mortheus fading in and out, the Ghemina's Lord and Lady finishing each other's sentences, the Arborec's
// words swaying like leaves, the Creuss / Crimson whispering, the Zelian's growl grinding.
